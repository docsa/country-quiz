# CountryQuiz

Angular solution to devchallenges.io game quiz

I use a bus event to set and share app state in different components

live run on `http://docsa.io/country-quiz`
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
